        <h1>Dear Suchitra,</h1>

        <p>
          Just a small reminder 🤍  
          you are doing better than you think.
        </p>

        <p>
          The way you stay kind, even when things feel heavy,  
          says so much about your heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your strength doesn’t always shout —  
          sometimes it shows up quietly, every single day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keep believing in yourself 🌸  
          you are growing in ways you don’t even notice yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          And no matter where life takes you,  
          I’ll always be cheering for you — quietly, sincerely.
        </p>
